# K1-B0 Discord Bot

This is a small modular discord bot, designed to do a variety of features, from respond to commands to automatically 
give a user a role on joining a voice channel

### Installation

Start by cloning the repo using:\
`git clone https://github.com/Kamg300/K1-B0t`

Next, you need to copy config.json.example to config.json, and then configure that file. Be warned, if `enableVoiceTextChannel`
is enabled, but the channel and role are undefined/incorrect, then it will throw errors to console every time someone 
does anything in a voice channel
